        <h1>Project On Console</h1>
        <p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft.
             It is used to develop computer programs,
             as well as websites, web apps, 
            web services and mobile apps. ... Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting
             IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring.</p>

             <p>In computer technology, a console can mean different things depending on the context. It usually means a combination of a display
                  monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair,
                  which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output
                   from a computer or computer system.</p>
